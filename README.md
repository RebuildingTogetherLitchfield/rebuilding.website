  Rebuilding Together Litchfield County
</h1>

This is the repository for the new Rebuilding Together Litchfield website. This website will be built with [Gatsby Static Site Generator](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) including some [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and other web technologies. 


## üöÄ Quick start

Use NPM and the Gatsby CLI to build the site locally.

1. Clone the project.
2. `npm install` to get all dependencies
3. Using the GatsbyCLI run `gatsby develop` and you will be up and running with a development version. 
4. You can also use NPM by running `npm run develop` - (see scripts below for more)
5. Once you are happy with your changes you can then run `npm run build`



_Note: This project does use GraphQL. To use GraphQL in your browser: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._


## Scripts

* build: "gatsby build"
* develop: "gatsby develop -H 0.0.0.0 -p 8000"
* format: "prettier --write \"**/*.{js,jsx,json,md}\""
* start: "gatsby serve"
* test: "echo \"Write tests! -> https://gatsby.dev/unit-testing \""

## Directories and Files

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.
