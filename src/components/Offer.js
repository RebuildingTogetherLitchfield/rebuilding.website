          There are things that slip by in a house. Upkeep we never seem to get
          around to doing. The roof starts leaking. The furnace isn't working
          properly. Windows break. Heating bills escalate or worse, the house is
          just cold all the time.
        </p>
        <p className="offer-text">
          There are things we need to add as we get older too. Simple things --
          like a hand rail in the shower or changing the door knobs to handles
          so the doors are easier to open.
        </p>
        <p className="offer-text">
          Sometimes getting these things done becomes too much for us to do
          alone and hiring a contractor can be confusing and unaffordable.

          We are your neighbors. You've helped others for years and we think it
          is your turn to receive some help. We are the volunteers of Rebuilding
          Together Litchfield County. Some of us are skilled laborers like
          carpenters, electricians, and plumbers. Some of us are just willing
          helpers.

          If you need help or know someone who does, let us know ... please.
